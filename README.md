## How to Play
Click on cards to use them.
CD is cooldown, MU is mana use. You gain 5 mana per turn. (Changes depending on difficulty)
ATK is damage, HP is health.
Every 20 turns (10 turns for you and opponent), death mode ramps up. This decreases both players' health, and also gives them extra mana to use more cards. Eventually, the game will have to end.
## Difficulties
Easy - More health & mana gain & attack
Normal - Standard
Hard - Slightly less health
Insane - Cards have half the health of enemy's crds
Cataclysm - 75 hp, cards have 5 hp and you cannot heal. **(UNTESTED, PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK)**
